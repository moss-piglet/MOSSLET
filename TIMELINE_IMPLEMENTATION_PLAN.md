# 🚀 Timeline Implementation Plan

## 📋 Overview

This plan implements the complete functional timeline by connecting your existing backend to your beautiful liquid metal design while maintaining encryption-first architecture.

**The Problem**: Your timeline template is currently a beautiful design mockup with static data, but your backend is fully functional! We need to connect them.

**The Solution**: Replace the mockup template with real data-driven components while maintaining the exact same beautiful design.

## 🔐 Encryption Architecture

Your system uses a sophisticated **three-layer encryption architecture**:

### 🏗️ The Three Layers

1. **User Table** - Personal encrypted data (encrypted with `user_key`)
2. **Connection Table** - Shared profile data (encrypted with `conn_key`)
3. **UserConnection Table** - Relationship-specific data (encrypted with connection-specific keys)

### 🔄 The Dual-Update Pattern

When users update profile information, your system updates BOTH:

1. **User record** - encrypted with `user_key` (personal access only)
2. **Connection record** - encrypted with `conn_key` (shared with connections)

### 🔑 Post-Context Encryption

All timeline features follow the **post-context encryption** pattern:

- Each post has a unique `post_key` that encrypts ALL post-related content
- Users access via `user_post.key` (post_key encrypted with user's public key)
- Same key encrypts: `post.body`, `post.username`, `reply.body`, `bookmark.notes`
- Automatic cleanup when posts are deleted

### 📋 Encryption Rules for Timeline Features

1. **Post-Related Content** → Use existing `post_key` (same as `post.body`)
   - Bookmark notes, reply content, post-specific moderation data
2. **User-Specific Content** → Use `user_key` with dual-update pattern
   - Status messages, bookmark categories, user preferences
3. **System Data** → Plaintext enums and flags
   - Status values, colors, timestamps, foreign keys

## 🏆 Phase 1 Achievement Summary

### ✅ Complete Feature Set Implemented

Your timeline now has all major social media features:

1. **🔖 Bookmarks System** - Save posts with personal notes and categories
2. **🛡️ Content Moderation** - Report inappropriate content, block users, hide posts
3. **⚠️ Content Warnings** - Custom warning categories for sensitive content
4. **🟢 User Status System** - Rich status indicators shared with connections
5. **🔐 Enhanced Privacy** - Granular visibility controls and post expiration
6. **📋 Timeline Navigation** - Multiple timeline views with performance caching

### 🔑 Encryption Architecture Mastered

- ✅ **Context-Specific Keys** - Each post/group/connection gets unique encryption key
- ✅ **Public-Key Distribution** - Context keys encrypted with recipient's public key
- ✅ **Zero Knowledge** - Server never accesses decrypted content
- ✅ **Dual-Update Pattern** - Profile data encrypted for personal + sharing contexts
- ✅ **Post-Context Consistency** - All post-related features use same post_key

### 📊 Technical Excellence Achieved

- ✅ **Production Safety** - `transaction_on_primary` for all database writes

## 📚 Detailed Implementation Reference

<details>
<summary>🔐 Encryption Architecture Deep Dive</summary>

### Your Current Encryption Pattern

```elixir
# DEFAULT: Double encryption for all sensitive user data (enacl + Cloak)
field :email, Mosslet.Encrypted.Binary          # Double encrypted: enacl + Cloak
field :body, Mosslet.Encrypted.Binary           # Double encrypted: enacl + Cloak
field :username, Mosslet.Encrypted.Binary       # Double encrypted: enacl + Cloak

# SEARCHABLE HASHES: For finding encrypted data
field :email_hash, Mosslet.Encrypted.HMAC       # Searchable hash (weak hashing for search)
field :username_hash, Mosslet.Encrypted.HMAC    # Searchable hash (weak hashing for search)

# SECURE HASHES: For passwords and sensitive authentication
field :password_hash, :string                   # Argon2 strong hashing (no search needed)

# PLAINTEXT: Only for non-sensitive system data
field :color, Ecto.Enum                         # System data (colors, enums, etc.)
field :is_admin?, :boolean                      # System flags
field :inserted_at, :naive_datetime            # Timestamps
```

### Double Encryption Strategy

**Standard Approach**: All sensitive user data uses double encryption:

```elixir
# Double Encryption Flow:
# 1. User Input → "My private content"
# 2. First Layer (enacl) → Asymmetric encryption with user/post keys (zero-knowledge)
# 3. Second Layer (Cloak) → Symmetric encryption at rest (automatic via Encrypted.Binary)
# 4. Storage → Double-encrypted binary in database

# Schema definition:
field :my_sensitive_field, Mosslet.Encrypted.Binary  # Automatic double encryption

# Implementation:
encrypted_content = Mosslet.Encrypted.Utils.encrypt(%{key: user_key, payload: content})
changeset |> put_change(:my_sensitive_field, encrypted_content)
```

### Post-Context Encryption Strategy

**Critical for Timeline Features**: All timeline content uses the `post_key` pattern:

1. Each post has a unique `post_key`
2. Users access via `user_post.key` (post_key encrypted with user's public key)
3. Same key encrypts ALL post-related content: `post.body`, `bookmark.notes`, `reply.body`
4. Automatic cleanup when posts are deleted
5. Consistent decryption across all post features

### Implementation Pattern

```elixir
# For Post-Related Features (bookmarks, replies, reports):
def create_bookmark(user, post, attrs) do
  # Get post_key using EXISTING mechanism
  user_post = Timeline.get_user_post(post, user)
  {:ok, post_key} = decrypt_user_attrs_key(user_post.key, user, session_key)

  %Bookmark{}
  |> Bookmark.changeset(attrs, post_key: post_key)  # Use post_key!
  |> put_assoc(:user, user)
  |> put_assoc(:post, post)
  |> Repo.transaction_on_primary(&Repo.insert/1)
end
```
