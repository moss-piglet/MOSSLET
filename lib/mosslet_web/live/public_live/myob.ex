                  We've been building and using computers for thirty years. We were around in 2000 when Google pioneered the invisible prison of surveillance capitalism and hid behind the thin veil of "Don't Be Evil". We've seen their strategies for collecting, selling, and abusing personal data on an industrial scale spread to every industry. We remember when Facebook rose from The FaceBook to the pusher of algorithmically-engineered traps of attention and worse. The internet didn't use to be like this, and it doesn't have to be like that today either.

                  But right now it just is. You have to defend yourself from these Big Tech giants, and the legion of companies following their nasty example. Collect It All has sunk into the ideology of the commercial internet, so most companies don't even think about it. It's just what they do.

                    MOSSLET doesn't mine your posts for data:
                  </strong>
                  There are no big AI engines to feed. We don't analyze what links you click, your interests, your location, who your friends are, what you say. We don't take your your face from your pictures, nothing personal other than the most basic identifying information we need to call you a customer. Everything else is simply none of our business. And because you pay to use MOSSLET, it doesn't need to be. Even then, we encrypt it all in a way so that we couldn't analyze or monetize it even if we wanted to â€” which we don't.

                  When you're in the business of "free", like Google, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and many others, you're in the business of snooping. Tricking. Collecting. Aggregating. Slicing. Dicing. Packaging. Do you really want to be used like that? As a resource to be mined? Do you really want companies secretly deciding and controlling your future? If you're here, and curious about MOSSLET, you probably don't.

                  Privacy used to be something exotic and niche. Today it's going mainstream, but it's still early. You can be early on this trend. You can be part of the change. Using MOSSLET is standing up, not giving in.
