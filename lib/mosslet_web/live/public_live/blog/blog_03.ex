          With the summer months upon us and a sense of travel in the air, it's disappointing to learn about a secretive contract between the Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) and the Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC) that began in June of 2024 and could extend to 2029.
        </p>

        <p>
          If flying on a major airline wasn't trouble enough, with increasing prices and crashes (due to faulty Boeing airplanes and understaffed and outdated air traffic control systems), the airlines have also been secretly selling passenger data to the Department of Homeland Security.

            board of directors
          </a>
          is made up of executives from the major airlines: Air Canada, Air France, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue Airways, Lufthansa, and Southwest Airlines. They are a
          <em>data broker</em>
          that collects and monetizes the data on all of their airline passengers (see <a href="/blog/articles/01">our article on data brokers</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          The ARC also facilitates business between the airlines and travel agencies like Expedia. The sale of passenger data to the United States government is part of the data broker's Travel Intelligence Program (TIP). This TIP program updates the travel data of passengers every single day and "contains more than
          <em>1 billion records</em>
          spanning 39 months of past and future travel."
        </p>

        <p>
          Anyone with access to the TIP program can search for airline passengers by name, credit card, or airline.

            A loophole for surveillance
          </a>
        </h2>

        <p>
          We mentioned earlier our
          <a href="/blog/articles/01">
            first blog article
          </a>
          covering the government's refusal to protect Americans from data brokers, a decision that functions to keep alive a loophole for surveillance — legally outsourcing the spying on American citizens to private corporations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not too long ago the American public rejected this kind of mass surveillance, then along came the tragedy on 9/11 and our leaders found a new argument to passify the public as they began bypassing our civil liberties and legal protections afforded us by the Constitution of the United States of America.

          As far as we know, the data in the ARC's Travel Intelligence Program is collected from third party travel agencies like Expedia. So,
          <strong>
            book your flights directly with the airline
          </strong>
          to possibly avoid this spying.

          </li>
          <li>
