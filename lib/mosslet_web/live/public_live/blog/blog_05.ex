                      Today we have a disturbing story about the further erosion of our right to privacy, thanks to a surveillance company (and the absence of strong privacy laws) that sells an AI service that can locate objects in your photos. The company specifically markets their service to people who want to locate someone based on a photograph of that person.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      To get a better idea of what this means, imagine you share a photo on Instagram, Facebook, X, Bluesky, Mastodon, or other social media surveillance platform (even a video on TikTok or YouTube), and in that photo is a harmless object (like a car or a building). But to this company's surveillance algorithm, that harmless object is a clue that can be used to determine your location at the time the photo was taken.

                    </h2>
                    <p>
                      When you upload a photograph online to share with your friends or family, you have a preconceived notion about the action you are taking and its possible effects on your life (eg. positive boost in connection and nostalgia with no permanent nor negative consequence). Surveillance companies and algorithms like the one mentioned in the article above, subvert this understanding by opening up invisible ways to exploit you and your safety (or that of your friends and family).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Instead of simply connecting with a loved one online, you have now given a stranger a Google street view of your home or last known location â€” which is what the service does. If the street view wasn't enough to locate you, the service also shares the latitude and longitude so that a stranger can quickly pull up turn-by-turn directions to you.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      As companies and tools like this invade our photographs in order to <em>invade us</em>, the "invisible" dangers of surveillance capitalism start to come into view. It doesn't take much to imagine a disgruntled person, or stalker, using a tool like this to find someone (let alone a disgrunteled government or organization).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Should we really have to live like Edward Snowden, putting blankets over our heads, to protect ourselves from being located by the background of our selfie?

                      The accuracy of digital spy services, and their AI algorithms, is only possible thanks to surveillance capitalism, which provides the data necessary for them to work (the food) as well as the market in which to sell them (the appetite).

                      rather than consume it. On MOSSLET you have greater control over your photographs:
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          the entire photo is encrypted (only you and people you choose to share with can decrypt them)
                        </li>
                        <li>you can control whether or not someone can download your photos</li>
                        <li>your photos are never sent outside of our network</li>
                        <li>
                          when you delete a photo it is immediately and permanently deleted
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                      These steps help ensure spy services can't wrap their tentacles around you. It's not perfect protection, you may connect with someone who takes a screenshot of your photograph (which is why you want to consider who you connect with online), but it goes a long way in preventing a lot of the surveillance danger online â€” and we'll keep working on ways to do even more.
