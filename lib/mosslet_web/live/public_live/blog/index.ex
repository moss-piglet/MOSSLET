                preview="What began as a convenient security device to protect your family, and packages, has morphed into a corporate (and state) surveillance tool that fundamentally changes the relationship between you and your insurance provider. When you install a smart doorbell, you're not just protecting your home — you're potentially giving insurance companies (and authorities) a 24/7 window into your private life."

But to this company's surveillance algorithm, that harmless object is a clue that can be used to determine your location at the time the photo was taken."

But that's exactly what is happening on these Big Tech services, our brains are being rewired to prioritize responding to an online notification over our real life interactions. It's not our fault, these systems are designed to hijack our biology and shift our behavior — and its killing us."

Its original rule was proposed last December under former director Rohit Chopra and would have gone a long way in shielding us from the indiscriminate sharing of our personal information — like social security numbers, addresses, phone numbers, you name it."
