# 🚀 Phase 2: Performance Infrastructure Implementation

## 📋 Overview

Now that Phase 1 (Core Architecture) is complete, we're implementing the performance foundation that will support smooth UI integration and scale effectively.

## 🎯 Phase 2 Goals

1. **2.1 Encrypted Caching Layer** - High-performance caching that works with encryption
2. **2.2 Broadway Processing Pipeline** - Background jobs for timeline optimization
3. **2.3 Timeline UI Integration** - Connect beautiful design to high-performance backend

## 🔐 Performance + Encryption Strategy

**Key Insight**: We can cache encrypted data without compromising security:

- ✅ Cache encrypted payloads (no decryption on server)
- ✅ Cache metadata for quick filtering
- ✅ Smart invalidation via PubSub events
- ✅ Multi-layer caching (ETS + Redis)

---
