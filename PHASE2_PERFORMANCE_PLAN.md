# 🚀 Phase 2: Performance Infrastructure Implementation

## 📋 Overview

Now that Phase 1 (Core Architecture) is complete, we're implementing the performance foundation that will support smooth UI integration and scale effectively.

## 🎯 Phase 2 Goals

1. **2.1 Encrypted Caching Layer** - High-performance caching that works with encryption
2. **2.2 Broadway Processing Pipeline** - Background jobs for timeline optimization
3. **2.3 Timeline UI Integration** - Connect beautiful design to high-performance backend

## 🔐 Performance + Encryption Strategy

**Key Insight**: We can cache encrypted data without compromising security:

- ✅ Cache encrypted payloads (no decryption on server)
- ✅ Cache metadata for quick filtering
- ✅ Smart invalidation via PubSub events
- ✅ Multi-layer caching (ETS + Redis)

---

# 🗃️ Phase 2.1: Encrypted Caching Layer

## ✅ Implementation Complete

**Achievement**: High-performance ETS caching system with encryption support

**What's Working**:
- ✅ **ETS Cache Store** - Fast in-memory encrypted data caching
- ✅ **Timeline Integration** - Cache-aware timeline functions
- ✅ **Smart Invalidation** - Real-time cache updates via PubSub
- ✅ **Multi-layer Strategy** - ETS + fallback patterns

---

# 🔄 Phase 2.2: Broadway Processing Pipeline

## ✅ Implementation Complete

**Achievement**: Background processing pipeline for timeline optimization

**What's Working**:
- ✅ **Oban + Broadway Integration** - Background job processing
- ✅ **Timeline Feed Generation** - Pre-computed feeds for performance
- ✅ **Batch Operations** - Efficient bulk processing
- ✅ **Background Cleanup** - Automated maintenance tasks

---

# 🎨 Phase 2.3: Timeline UI Integration

## ✅ Phase 2.3.1: Real Data Integration - COMPLETE

**Achievement**: Static mockup successfully replaced with real encrypted timeline data

**What Works**:
- ✅ Real encrypted posts loading from cache-optimized backend
- ✅ LiveView streams properly rendering encrypted data (`@streams.posts`)
- ✅ Post decryption using existing `decr_item()` and `get_post_key()` helpers
- ✅ Beautiful liquid metal design preserved 100%
- ✅ Real usernames, content, timestamps, interaction counts

## ✅ Phase 2.3.2: Functional Composer - COMPLETE

**Achievement**: Beautiful composer connected to real post creation backend

**What Works**:
- ✅ Real form validation using existing `@post_form` and `save_post` handler
- ✅ Character counting functional with proper show/hide behavior
- ✅ Privacy toggle cycling (Private → Connections → Public → Private)
- ✅ Form content preservation across all interactions
- ✅ "Share thoughtfully" button submits posts successfully
- ✅ Textarea content properly preserved during LiveView updates
- ✅ All required hidden fields (user_id, username, visibility) included
- ✅ Form crash fixed with proper error handling
- ✅ Uses existing `user_name()` and avatar helpers from MossletWeb.Helpers

## ✅ Phase 2.3.3: Form Content Preservation - COMPLETE

**Achievement**: Perfect form behavior without data loss

**What We Fixed**:
- 🔧 **Root Cause**: LiveView re-rendering and textarea value attribute behavior
- 🔧 **Privacy Toggle**: Client-side preservation via proper event handling
- 🔧 **Form State**: Proper changeset management across validations
- 🔧 **Textarea Behavior**: Using inner content instead of value attribute
- 🔧 **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and type-safe operations

**Technical Achievements**:
- ✅ Form content never lost during privacy changes
- ✅ Character counter shows/hides properly based on content
- ✅ Privacy toggle cycles smoothly without form reset
- ✅ All LiveView re-renders preserve user input
- ✅ Validation errors display properly without crashes
- ✅ Type-safe operations (Dialyzer clean)
