# 🚀 Phase 2: Performance Infrastructure Implementation

## 📋 Overview

Now that Phase 1 (Core Architecture) is complete, we're implementing the performance foundation that will support smooth UI integration and scale effectively.

## 🎯 Phase 2 Goals

1. **2.1 Encrypted Caching Layer** - High-performance caching that works with encryption
2. **2.2 Broadway Processing Pipeline** - Background jobs for timeline optimization
3. **2.3 Timeline UI Integration** - Connect beautiful design to high-performance backend

## 🔐 Performance + Encryption Strategy

**Key Insight**: We can cache encrypted data without compromising security:

- ✅ Cache encrypted payloads (no decryption on server)
- ✅ Cache metadata for quick filtering
- ✅ Smart invalidation via PubSub events
- ✅ Multi-layer caching (ETS + Redis)

# 🗃️ Phase 2.1: Encrypted Caching Layer

## Implementation Plan

### 2.1.1 ETS-Based Timeline Cache

**Goal**: Fast in-memory caching for frequently accessed encrypted data

### 2.1.2 Integration with Timeline Context

**Goal**: Modify existing timeline functions to use caching

### 2.1.3 Cache Invalidation Strategy

**Goal**: Real-time cache invalidation via PubSub events

---

# 🔄 Phase 2.2: Broadway Processing Pipeline

## Implementation Plan

### 2.2.1 Timeline Feed Generation

**Goal**: Pre-compute timeline feeds in background

### 2.2.2 Batch Encryption Operations

**Goal**: Optimize encryption/decryption with batching

### 2.2.3 Background Cleanup Tasks

**Goal**: Automated maintenance and optimization

# 🎨 Phase 2.3: Timeline UI Integration

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### ✅ 2.3.1 Real Data Integration - COMPLETE

**Achievement**: Static mockup successfully replaced with real encrypted timeline data

**What Works**:

- ✅ Real encrypted posts loading from cache-optimized backend
- ✅ LiveView streams properly rendering encrypted data (`@streams.posts`)
- ✅ Post decryption using existing `decr_item()` and `get_post_key()` helpers
- ✅ Beautiful liquid metal design preserved 100%
- ✅ Real usernames, content, timestamps, interaction counts

### ✅ 2.3.2 Functional Composer - COMPLETE

**Achievement**: Beautiful composer connected to real post creation backend

**What Works**:

- ✅ Real form validation using existing `@post_form` and `save_post` handler
- ✅ Character counting functional (90/500)
- ✅ Share button enabled/disabled states working
- ✅ Form crash fixed with proper event handling
- ✅ Uses existing `user_name()` and avatar helpers from MossletWeb.Helpers

### 🎯 2.3.3 Interactive Features - IN PROGRESS

**Goal**: Make Like/Reply/Bookmark buttons fully functional with real backend

**Status**: Ready to implement - buttons are designed and rendered, need backend connection

---

✅ **Phase 2.1 & 2.2 Complete!** ETS cache, Oban jobs, and Broadway pipeline implemented.

🎯 **Ready for Phase 2.3 UI Integration** - Connect your beautiful liquid metal design to the high-performance encrypted backend!
